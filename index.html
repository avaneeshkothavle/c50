    <h4>
        Thomas Alva Edison, born in Ohio on February 11, 1847, was one of the most well-known inventors of all time.

        Thomas Alva Edison (February 11, 1847 – October 18, 1931) was an American inventor and businessman who has been described as America's greatest inventor.
        <br>
        <br>

        He has invented the bulb. In the period from 1878 to 1880 Edison and his associates worked on at least three thousand different theories to develop an efficient incandescent lamp.
        Three factors in combination are generally recognized as contributing to Edison’s success:
        <br><br>
        A durable incandescent material
        <br>
        Elimination of air from the bulb-a better vacuum
        <br>
        A filament material of high resistance
